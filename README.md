1.3" SPI LCD Workout Demo

I wanted to use a display with the Raspberry Pi Pico but didn't want to use the ones where you just plug the pico into the display (e.g. like this one https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack even if it is brilliant)

This is the 1.3" display I brought, a bargain at Â£15 https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/1-3-spi-colour-lcd-240x240-breakout

Wiring was a case of following their docs but driving the display took a bit longer before I realised the naming of their examples.

This is a version of a great display workout I found here (TODO) that I then updated to cope with the different sized screen and the way to drive this board rather than the one I mentioned above.

TODO finish updating. This is a placeholder as I want to reuse the pico for a macro keyboard driver.
